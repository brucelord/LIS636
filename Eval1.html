<p>According to <a href="https://www.marketing91.com/components-of-a-website/" alt="marketing91.com" target="_blank">marketing91.com</a> there are seven (actually eight) website must-haves:
<ol>
	<li>Navigation</li>
	<li>Web hosting</li>
	<li>Call-to-Actions</li>
	<li>Headline</li>
	<li>About Us</li>
	<li>Content</li>
	<li>Visuals</li>
	<li>Mobile friendliness</li>
</ol>
I believe the UNCG Library website has all eight of these components. Navigation is made easy with helpful headings that have drop downs at the top of the page, as well as the onesearch bar under the UNCG banner. Obviously as a website that's part of an academic institution, UNCG has extensive web hosting capabilities with high functioning servers and backup files to ensure a high quality website. There are many call-to-action functions, as evidenced by the chat with a librarian link as well as links to phone numbers which when clicked on from a phone will prompt the user to make a phone call. The headline is very straightforward and makes it clear to the user that they are on a UNCG library website. This is accomplished by the "University Libraries" headline right under the UNCG banner. There is an about us section that when hovered over offers various links to informational sections about the libraries. This is a library website so there is plenty of content to explore, whether it be searching the catalog to find an eBook, or physical book, or reserving a study space, content is abound on this website. Visuals are an important component for library websites because you don't want a boring library site and UNCG does a good job of utilizing inviting visuals on their site. This is evidenced by the picture right on the homepage of what looks to be a study area where people are collaborating and working independently. This creates a welcoming feeling for the user. Lastly, the site is very mobile friendly. It compacts the site to make it easily scrollable without seeming bunched together.

Library websites are created to help guide users to the resources they are looking for. The UNCG library website is no exception to this rule. As discussed earlier, the website makes the user feel welcomed, but also offers numerous ways to help the user find the information they need. This is evidenced by the chat with a librarian link, as well as the ability to search by a variety of parameters right from the homepage. According to <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/tasks-for-growing-website/" alt="makeawebsitehub.com" target="_blank">makeawebsitehub.com</a>, websites in general are created to engage users and create awareness of a brand, among other things. This resonates with me because I've always seen websites as another way for a company to reach their users and gain new ones. The UNCG Library website accomplishes this by offering links to social media pages, as well as library news and events, right on the homepage.
